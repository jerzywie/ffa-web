Family Food Action Web

## Overview

This is the code for a map of FFA locations, published on the FFA website

### Updating the map

Open `collectors.html` as a file in a browser. Clicking on the map gives the lat/long of the location - for copying and pasting into the list of shortcodes.

The map pins and map key are rendered from Wordpress Short Codes. These all live in the wordpress directory.
